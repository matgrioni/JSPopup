A simple javascript file that displays a popup and can be styled. Requires
jQuery. Based off nhoening/popup.js which is displays a popup when an element
is hovered over. However, this did not fit all my needs so I made this copy
which is sufficiently different to not warrant a fork, but a different repo.

Enjoy!
